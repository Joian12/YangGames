I know that being with someone you love, you care for and gave almost very second of your life to that person is a really big commitment 
and the fact that "someone" didn't appreciate enough your efforts for them to stay is a really distressing experience. This world is really unforgiving and 
the people who lived in this world will probably take advantage of you in many ways, but that doesn't mean that you need to close yourself from people 
who are willing to know you and do better for you. 

Time is a very valuable asset of a human life. When it is used, there's no way that you can have it back and it will remain lost forever. You already have spent
a lot of time with me and that time would not be wasted. Our time together will only be used to heighten our affection to each other and because of that, I would want to spend all of my time with you and that's probably the last thing I would think about in my life. Everything I'am and will be, will always be part of you.

For you, The word "love" might be an overstatement to a person who is expressing his feelings to his love ones and maybe you don't want to be involved with it, but i do. Love is what drives us to do better and makes us want to live longer. It is proven that a person of your age should experience a handy dose of love from a guy like me and as a result, you will have a positive outcome in life. It's a wonderful feeling spending time with a special someone and as you said it will decrease the level of your stress and drastically improve your mood. So, take my love and be embraced with it's warmth.

Having a love one in your life is the easiest part. the hardest part is maintaining it for a long time and it's called "commitment". It's a big word for people who only used to flirt with someone else. Making them fall in love then leave them after the feelings fade away, it's such a shameful act of cowardness towards a person who risked a lot to be with you. I will not be like them, my words are not enough for you to trust me entirely. But my actions will be the bearer of my judgment and I will be committed to you as long as there is life in my body. 

My intentions are very clear as the sky in daylight. I want to be with you and I want to make you happy. All the struggles that you have been through, I guarantee you that it will all be forgotten. We will create more memorable experience that will be forever remembered by us. You will never feel lost again if you just hold my hand and never let go. You might not believe me right now, but I will show you someday that taking risks in relationship or in life in general have it's own rewards.

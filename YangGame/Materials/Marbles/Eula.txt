I know that being with someone you love, someone you care for and gave almost very second of your life to that someone is a really big commitment 
and the fact that "someone" didn't appreciate it enough for them to stay is a really distressing experience. This world is really unforgiving and 
people that lived in this world will probably take advantage of you in many ways but that doesn't mean that you need to close yourself from people 
who are willing to know you better and do better for you.
